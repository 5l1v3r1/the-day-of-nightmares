# From noob to 0day developer 

## Introduction 

the reason why I'm writting this kind of how-to become you into a exploit writer is because I had in the same boat as you , So I had to research link by link to find the right ones. I call this kind of how-to course from noob to hero covering the basics of penetration testing to the hottest topic such as Sandbox Escape. 

## The inspiration:

What has been kept me so interested and motivated into 0day research , and everything I googled led me to google security research team known as Google Project Zero. Don't judme maybe I cannot reach at that level yet, but the day I gave up on my dreams, I will be dead inside.


## Recommendations: 

* Aim for the impossible 
* This is not a basic course even if I call it "noob"
* Be prepared to suffer as much as possible 
* Nightmares
* Don't be afraid of assembly 
* Network with other cybersecurity folks
* Get familiar with WinDBG,Immunity , and IDA
* Don't be as those people who tell you "Try harder" (which in some cases means: I am not going to help you)
